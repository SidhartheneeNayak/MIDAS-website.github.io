# MIDAS-website.github.io
This is a sample MIDAS IIITD website which I have created as a part of Pre-Internship task 

One can go to master branch of this repository clone all the files there and run 'npm install' in the terminal  to download the the required node modules. Then one can type 'npm start' to start the local server at port 3000. After that in any browser one can run the localhost server and the website will be launched. Here I made a working login system but without any database. So, once refreshed or once the server is started again, the previous data will not be there so the user need sto register again.
The YouTube video link for the working of the web-app is given below:
